## Lists

In Python, lists are ordered collections of items that allow for easy use of a set of data.

List values are placed in between square brackets <code>[ ]</code>, separated by commas. It is good practice to put a space between the comma and the next value. The values in a list do not need to be unique (the same value can be repeated).

<pre class="file" data-filename="lists.py" data-target="append">
breakfast = ["bread", "butter", "milk"]
print(breakfast)
</pre>

Empty lists do not contain any values within the square brackets.

<pre class="file" data-filename="lists.py" data-target="append">
empty_list=[]
</pre>

## Adding Lists Together

Lists can be added to each other using the plus symbol <code>+</code>. This will result in a new list containing the same items in the same order with the first listâ€™s items coming first.

<pre class="file" data-filename="lists.py" data-target="append">
fruits = ["apples", "cherries"]
shopping_list = breakfast + fruits
print(shopping_list)
# Result: ["bread", "butter", "milk", "apples", "cherries"]
</pre>

Note: This will not work for adding a single item to the list, as in: <code><del>shopping_list = shopping_list + "cookies"</del></code>. To do this, either use the <code>append()</code> method or use the plus symbol to add a new list with a single value:

<pre class="file" data-filename="lists.py" data-target="append">
shopping_list.append("cookies")
shopping_list = shopping_list + ["peanuts"] # (or better: shopping_list += ["peanuts"])
# Result: ["bread", "butter", "milk", "apples", "cherries", "cookies", "peanuts"]
</pre>

## Accessing list items with indices

<pre class="file" data-filename="lists.py" data-target="append">
print(shopping_list[0]) # Result: bread
print(shopping_list[2]) # Result: milk

# All items from index 1 to 3 inclusive
print(shopping_list[1:4])
# Result: ["butter", "milk", "bread"]
# First 2 items
print(shopping_list[:2])
# Items from index 4 to the end
print(shopping_list[4:])
</pre>


<pre class="file" data-filename="lists.py" data-target="append">

</pre>
